# eEstateAgent
Developed a chatbot for interacting with buyers and sellers for a real estate property eliminating the need for a middleman, thereby, reducing the risks associated with the credibility of the buyer/seller/property before closing/transaction.   

This is what the judges of the show had to say about our ChatBot:
"Designing a chat bot is easy. Building one that works, with multiple technologies like PubNub Blocks and IBM Cloud Analysis—in a weekend—that is a daunting task. This team built a chat bot to broker as an intermediary between buyers and sellers in real estate transactions."
